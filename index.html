    <h1>The Great Spider</h1>
    <h2>By Daniel Arnould</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Spider, Spider, on the wall, </p>
    <p>Before my life would take a fall, </p>
    <p>There it sits so peacefully</p>
    <p>As my husband and I live so blissfully.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>As Brisbane winds break through, </p>
    <p>Our father's trumpets blew, </p>
    <p>Bereft an adventure I could not give</p>
    <p>He left to fight and alone I live.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Spider, why is this house so big?</p>
    <p>I swear you've moved, </p>
    <p>Since we last met, </p>
    <p>I can't recall</p>
    <p>I'm so upset.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>A pain that stops and starts, </p>
    <p>Like a telegram stuck to my heart, </p>
    <p>Fearing the news of my sweetheart</p>
    <p>Ever since we've been apart.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>A few months pass sans return, </p>
    <p>Time to get a job, since they've unturned, </p>
    <p>A man's job is not for me, </p>
    <p>But I want to help with all I can</p>
    <p>"Volunteer!" said the newsman.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Days and days, </p>
    <p>I spend in factories, </p>
    <p>Making care packages, </p>
    <p>For the cavalry, </p>
    <p>But in each of them, </p>
    <p>I slide in case it's you, </p>
    <p>A reminder of my love</p>
    <p>That you know is true.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Down and down, </p>
    <p>The spider goes, </p>
    <p>Without the gunfire</p>
    <p>That you must pose.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>A year passes - I still cannot see, </p>
    <p>My only love the world gave to me, </p>
    <p>The factories closed a while ago, </p>
    <p>Now where should I go?</p>
    <p>A postman came with his telegram, </p>
    <p>Now who will bring me my children?</p>
    <p>Is the thought I am.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Spider, Spider, familiar friend, </p>
    <p>It seems you've reached your end, </p>
    <p>Hurry away across the floor, </p>
    <p>I'm no use any more, </p>
    <p>So dead with you I choose to lay</p>
    <p>Heaven far away...</p>
